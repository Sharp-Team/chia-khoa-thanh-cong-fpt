There are a number of situations in software engineering when it is important for disparate groups of programmers to agree to a "contract" that spells out how their software ____.

Interface:
A company calls SoftwareFactory makes a package of digital image processing ____ that are sold to companies making ____ graphics programs (Adobe). The image processing company (SoftwareFactory) writes its classes to implement an ____, which it makes public to it's costumers. Adobe then invokes the image processing methods using the signatures and return types defined in the interface. While the SoftwareFactory's API is made public (to its customers), its implementation of the API is kept as a closely guarded secret—in fact, it may revise the implementation at a later date as long as it continues to implement the original interface that its customers have relied on. | methods, end-user, interface
