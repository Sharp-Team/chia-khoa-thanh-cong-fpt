External consistency refers to designing operations, interfaces, etc., to be the same across applications and devices |  Very rarely the case, based on different designer’s preference															
Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it |  	a mouse button invites pushing, a door handle affords pulling- Affordances														
Norman (1988) |  used the term to discuss the design of everyday objects- Affordances															
Since has been much popularised in interaction design to discuss how to design interface objects |  scrollbars to afford moving up and down, icons to afford clicking on- Affordances															
Interfaces are virtual and do not have affordances like |   physical objects- What does ‘affordance’ have tooffer interaction design															
Norman argues it does not make sense to talk about interfaces in |   terms of ‘real’ affordances- What does ‘affordance’ have tooffer interaction design															
Instead interfaces are better conceptualized as ‘perceived’ affordances |  Learned conventions of arbitrary mappings between action and effect at the interface, Some mappings are better than others

Having a good understanding of the problem space can help inform the design space | what kind of interface, behavior, functionality to provide- From problem space to design space															
But before  | deciding upon these it is important to develop a conceptual model- From problem space to design space															
Need to first think about how the system will |  appear to users (i.e. how they will understand it)- conceptual model															
A conceptual model is: |  a high-level description of how a system isorganized and operates. (Johnson andHenderson, 2002, p. 26)															
Not a description of the user interface but a |  structure outlining the concepts and the relationships between them- What is and why need a conceptual model															
Why not start with the nuts and bolts of design | Architects and interior designers would not think about which color curtains to have before deciding where the windows will beplaced in a new building															
Why not start with the nuts and bolts of design | Enables “designers to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets” (p. 28)															
Why not start with the nuts and bolts of design | Provides a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations															
Orient themselves towards asking |  questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by users- Helps the design team															
Not to become narrowly focused |  early on- Helps the design team															
Establish a set |  of common terms they all understand and agree upon- Helps the design team

Theories, models and frameworks |  Are used to inform and inspire design															
A theory is  | a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon															
A model is |  a simplification of some aspect of human–computer interaction intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs															
A framework is  | a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions															
Theories tend to be  | comprehensive, explaining human–computer interactions															
Models tend to  | simplify some aspect of human–computer interaction															
Frameworks tend to be  | prescriptive, providing designers with concepts, questions, and principles to consider															
Need to have a good understanding of the problem space | specifying what it is you aredoing, why, and how it will support users in the way intended															
A conceptual model is ahigh-level description of a product | what users can do with it and the concepts they need to understand how to interact with it															
Decisions about conceptual design should be |  made before commencing any physical design															
Interface metaphors are |  commonly used as part of a conceptual model															
We need to  | take into account cognitive processes involved and cognitive limitations of users															
We can provide knowledge about  | what users can and cannot be expected to do															
Identify and explain the nature and causes of problems users encounter | Why do we need to understand users															
Supply theories, modelling tools, guidance and methods that can |  lead to the design of better interactive products															
Core cognitive aspects |  Attention, Perception and recognition, Memory, Reading, speaking and listening, Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making, learning															
Core cognitive aspects | Most relevant to interaction design are attention,perception and recognition, and memory															
Allows us to focus on information that is |  relevant to what we are doing- Attention															
Involves audio and/or visual senses |  Attention															
Selecting things to concentrate on at a point |  in time from the mass of stimuli around us- Attention															
Focussed and divided attention enables us to be |  selective in terms of the mass of competing stimuli but limits our ability to keep track of all events- Attention															
Information at the interface should be structured to capture users’ attention |  e.g. use perceptual boundaries (windows),colour, reverse video, sound and flashing lights- Attention															
Tullis (1987) |  found that the two screens produced quite different results															
Make information salient  | when it needs attending to-Design implications for attention															
Use techniques that make things stand out |  like colour, ordering, spacing, underlining, sequencing and animation-Design implications for attention															
Avoid cluttering the |  interface - follow the google.com example of crisp, simple design-Design implications for attention

Representations of information need to be  | designed to be perceptible and recognizable- Design implications															
Icons and other graphical representations should enable |  users to readily distinguish their meaning- Design implications															
Bordering and spacing are  | effective visual ways of grouping information- Design implications															
Sounds should be  | audible and distinguishable- Design implications															
Speech output should enable  | users to distinguish between the set of spoken words- Design implications															
Text should be  | legible and distinguishable from the background- Design implications															
Involves first  | encoding and then retrieving knowledge- Memory															
We don’t remember  | everything - involves filtering and processing what is attended to- Memory															
Context is  | important in affecting our memory (i.e., where, when)- Memory															
Well known fact that we recognize things much better than being able to recall things | Better at remembering images than words, Why interfaces are largely visual- Memory															
Encoding is first stage of memory | determines which information is attended to in the environment and how it is interpreted- Processing in memory															
The more attention paid to something | Processing in memory															
And the more it is processed in terms of thinking about it and comparing it with other knowledge | Processing in memory															
Context affects the extent to  | which information can be subsequently retrieved															
Sometimes it can be difficult for people to  | recall information that was encoded in a different context															
Command-based interfaces require users to |  recall from memory a name from a possible set of 100s- Recognition versus recall															
GUIs provide visually-based options that users need only |  browse through until they recognize one- Recognition versus recall															
Web browsers, MP3 players, etc., provide lists of visited URLs, song titles etc., |  that support recognition memory- Recognition versus recall															
Personal information management (PIM) is a growing problem for most users |  Who have vast numbers of documents, images, music files, video clips, emails, attachments, bookmarks, etc.,															
Major problem is |  deciding where and how to save them all, then remembering what they were called and where to find them again															
Naming most |  common means of encoding them															
Memory involves 2 processes | recall-directed and recognition-based scanning															
File management systems should be designed to optimize both kinds of memory processes | e.g., Search box and history list															
Help users encode files in richer ways | Provide them with ways of saving files using colour, flagging, image, flexible text, time stamping, etc															
Don’t overload users’ memories with |  complicated procedures for carrying out tasks- Design implications

People’s accounts greatly varied and |  were often ad hoc															
Proposes 7 stages of an activity | Establish a goal, Form an intention, Specify an action sequence, Execute an action, Perceive the system state, Interpret the state, Evaluate the system state with respect to the goals and intentions															
Human activity does not |  proceed in such an orderly and sequential manner															
More usual for stages to be |  missed, repeated or out of order															
Do not always |  have a clear goal in mind but react to the world															
Theory is only |  approximation of what happens and is greatly simplified															
Help designers think about |  how to help users monitor their actions															
The ‘gulfs’ explicate the gaps that exist  | between the user and the interface
