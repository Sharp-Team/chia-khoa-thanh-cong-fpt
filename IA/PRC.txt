# You are designing a Windows Azure web application that includes many static content files. The application will be accessed from locations all over the world by using a custom domain. You need to recommend an approach for providing access to the static content with the lowest possible latency. Which two actions should you recommend? (Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Choose two.) | Place the static content in Windows Azure Blob storage. &&& Configure a custom domain that is an alias for the Windows Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domain.
# What type of storage will you use in a private cloud? | In-house storage and vendor tie-up
# Which is not a common way to store data permanently as a service? | As a file in root directory of a running machine
# We are using Windows Azure Service Bus Topics and Subscriptions. One Topic A has two Supscriptions S1 and S2. If a message in Topic A was read by S1, will S2 read the same message? | Yes, the message was removed from the topic A after it was read by S1 but then was reinserted before it was read by S2
