Main benefit is consistent interfaces are | easier to learn and use- Consistency
When consistency breaks down | Have to find other initials or combinations of keys, thereby breaking the consistency rule - e.g. ctrl+S, ctrl+Sp, ctrl+shift+L
Increases learning burden on user, making them more prone to errors | When consistency breaks down
Internal consistency refers to designing operations to behave the same within an application | Difficult to achieve with complex interfaces

But before | deciding upon these it is important to develop a conceptual model- From problem space to design space
Need to first think about how the system will | appear to users (i.e. how they will understand it)- conceptual model
A conceptual model is: | a high-level description of how a system isorganized and operates. (Johnson andHenderson, 2002, p. 26)
Not a description of the user interface but a | structure outlining the concepts and the relationships between them- What is and why need a conceptual model
Why not start with the nuts and bolts of design | Architects and interior designers would not think about which color curtains to have before deciding where the windows will beplaced in a new building

Theories, models and frameworks | Are used to inform and inspire design
A theory is | a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon
A model is | a simplification of some aspect of human'computer interaction intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs
A framework is | a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions
Theories tend to be | comprehensive, explaining human'computer interactions
Models tend to | simplify some aspect of human'computer interaction
Frameworks tend to be | prescriptive, providing designers with concepts, questions, and principles to consider
Need to have a good understanding of the problem space | specifying what it is you aredoing, why, and how it will support users in the way intended
A conceptual model is ahigh-level description of a product | what users can do with it and the concepts they need to understand how to interact with it
Decisions about conceptual design should be | made before commencing any physical design
Interface metaphors are | commonly used as part of a conceptual model
We need to | take into account cognitive processes involved and cognitive limitations of users
We can provide knowledge about | what users can and cannot be expected to do
Identify and explain the nature and causes of problems users encounter | Why do we need to understand users
Supply theories, modelling tools, guidance and methods that can | lead to the design of better interactive products
Core cognitive aspects | Attention, Perception and recognition, Memory, Reading, speaking and listening, Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making, learning
Core cognitive aspects | Most relevant to interaction design are attention,perception and recognition, and memory
Allows us to focus on information that is | relevant to what we are doing- Attention
Involves audio and/or visual senses | Attention
Selecting things to concentrate on at a point | in time from the mass of stimuli around us- Attention
Focussed and divided attention enables us to be | selective in terms of the mass of competing stimuli but limits our ability to keep track of all events- Attention
Information at the interface should be structured to capture users' attention | e.g. use perceptual boundaries (windows),colour, reverse video, sound and flashing lights- Attention
Tullis (1987) | found that the two screens produced quite different results
Make information salient | when it needs attending to-Design implications for attention
Use techniques that make things stand out | like colour, ordering, spacing, underlining, sequencing and animation-Design implications for attention
Avoid cluttering the | interface - follow the google.com example of crisp, simple design-Design implications for attention
Avoid using too much because | the software allows it-Design implications for attention
Representations of information need to be | designed to be perceptible and recognizable- Design implications
Icons and other graphical representations should enable | users to readily distinguish their meaning- Design implications
Bordering and spacing are | effective visual ways of grouping information- Design implications
Sounds should be | audible and distinguishable- Design implications
Speech output should enable | users to distinguish between the set of spoken words- Design implications
Text should be | legible and distinguishable from the background- Design implications
Involves first | encoding and then retrieving knowledge- Memory
We don't remember | everything - involves filtering and processing what is attended to - Memory
Context is | important in affecting our memory (i.e., where, when) - Memory
Well known fact that we recognize things much better than being able to recall things | Better at remembering images than words, Why interfaces are largely visual - Memory
Encoding is first stage of memory | determines which information is attended to in the environment and how it is interpreted- Processing in memory
The more attention paid to something | Processing in memory
And the more it is processed in terms of thinking about it and comparing it with other knowledge | Processing in memory
Context affects the extent to | which information can be subsequently retrieved
Sometimes it can be difficult for people to | recall information that was encoded in a different context
Command-based interfaces require users to | recall from memory a name from a possible set of 100s- Recognition versus recall
GUIs provide visually-based options that users need only | browse through until they recognize one- Recognition versus recall
Web browsers, MP3 players, etc., provide lists of visited URLs, song titles etc., | that support recognition memory- Recognition versus recall
Personal information management (PIM) is a growing problem for most users | Who have vast numbers of documents, images, music files, video clips, emails, attachments, bookmarks, etc.,
Major problem is | deciding where and how to save them all, then remembering what they were called and where to find them again
Naming most | common means of encoding them
Memory involves 2 processes | recall-directed and recognition-based scanning
File management systems should be designed to optimize both kinds of memory processes | e.g., Search box and history list
Help users encode files in richer ways | Provide them with ways of saving files using colour, flagging, image, flexible text, time stamping, etc
Don't overload users memories with | complicated procedures for carrying out tasks- Design implications
Design interfaces that | promote recognition rather than recall- Design implications
Provide users with a variety of ways of encoding digital information to | help them remember where they have stored them |  e.g., categories, color, flagging, time stamping- Design implications															
Users develop an understanding of a system through | learning and using it- Mental models
Knowledge is often described as a mental model | How to use the system (what to do next), What to do with unfamiliar systems or unexpected situations (how the system works)- Mental models
People make inferencesusing mental models of | how to carry out tasks- Mental models
Craik (1943) described mental models as | internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made- Mental models
Involves unconscious and conscious processes, | where images and analogies are activated- Mental models
Deep versus shallow models | how to drive a car and how it works- Mental models
Many people have erroneous mental models | (Kempton, 1996)
Payne (1991) | did a similar study and found that people frequently resort to analogies to explain how they work
People's accounts greatly varied and | were often ad hoc
Proposes 7 stages of an activity | Establish a goal, Form an intention, Specify an action sequence, Execute an action, Perceive the system state, Interpret the state, Evaluate the system state with respect to the goals and intentions
